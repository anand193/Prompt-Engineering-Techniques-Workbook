🌟 Advanced Prompt Engineering Portfolio (Gemini API)

A curated collection of advanced prompt engineering techniques designed and implemented using the Google Gemini API.
This portfolio demonstrates the ability to design, evaluate, and refine prompts to produce precise, reliable, and high-quality outputs for real-world applications.

🚀 Project Overview

This workbook showcases practical mastery of Prompt Engineering by applying progressively advanced strategies to solve a diverse set of language and reasoning tasks.

The focus is on building robust, controllable AI systems through well-architected prompting protocols rather than ad-hoc prompts.

🛠️ Techniques Demonstrated

The portfolio is structured into thematic categories, each highlighting key capabilities:

1. Foundational & Contextual Prompting

Role, Goal, Context, Format (RGCF)
- Structured output templates
- Delimiters for clarity
- Zero-Shot classification
- ATS-style resume/job scoring

2. Example-Based Learning
- Few-Shot prompting for:
   - Mathematical problem-solving
   - Information extraction
   - SQL query generation

3. Advanced Reasoning
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
- Step-by-step problem decomposition
- Long-context decision making
  - Example: career development roadmap

4. Strategic Thinking
- Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) reasoning
- Multi-path exploration
- Comparative evaluation & synthesis
  - Example: job offer evaluation, study planning

5. Reliability & Verification
- Self-Consistency prompting
- Multi-method calculation cross-check

6. Multimodal Understanding
