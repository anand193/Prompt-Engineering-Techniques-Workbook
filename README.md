🛠️ Techniques Demonstrated

The portfolio is structured into thematic categories, each highlighting key capabilities:

1. Foundational & Contextual Prompting

Role, Goal, Context, Format (RGCF)
- Structured output templates
- Delimiters for clarity
- Zero-Shot classification
- ATS-style resume/job scoring

2. Example-Based Learning
- Few-Shot prompting for:
   - Mathematical problem-solving
   - Information extraction
   - SQL query generation

3. Advanced Reasoning
- Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
- Step-by-step problem decomposition
- Long-context decision making
  - Example: career development roadmap

4. Strategic Thinking
- Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) reasoning
- Multi-path exploration
- Comparative evaluation & synthesis
  - Example: job offer evaluation, study planning

5. Reliability & Verification
- Self-Consistency prompting
- Multi-method calculation cross-check

6. Multimodal Understanding
